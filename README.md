The loan quote process flow goes like this:
1. Receive the consumer's loan quote request (ssn, loan amount, loan duration)
2. Obtain credit score from credit agency (ssn ïƒ  credit score)
3. Determine the most appropriate banks to contact from the Rule Base web service
4. Send a request to each selected bank (ssn, credit score, loan amount, loan duration)
5. Collect response from each selected bank
6. Determine the best response
7. Pass the result back to the consumer
